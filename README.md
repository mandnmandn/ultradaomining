Ultra DAO (UDAO) applies the proof of work mining schedule and adjusting difficulty of Bitcoin (BTC) [1] to an EOSIO Token.

50 UDAO are minted every 10 minutes for about 4 years, then the amount minted halves. This repeats until there are 21 million UDAO, exactly like BTC.

Ultra CPU resources are used to mine UDAO by transferring UOS to "". Each time you send UOS to the "" contract account, that exact amount of UOS plus 0.0025% of the total UDAO supply in the "contract" account will be transferred back to you.  

Anyone can mine UDAO after using the setupminer action. UDAO minting will continue until supply reaches 21 Million.

UDAO is a soulbound token meaning once mined it is non transferable.

CPU mining on Ultra is proof of work mining without the threat of a 51% attack. Proof of work is the fairest, most decentralized means of distribution.

Use your UOS tokens as blockchain cryptocurrency miners in perpetuity. UOS Tokens don't need power or upgrading to stay competitive against other miners on Ultra. The inflation in UOS is your cost of maintenance, electricity, and upgrades. Use your UOS to its full potential instead of letting it go to waste.
